# Tech_Quiz_Test_Suite

## Project Overview

The **Tech Quiz Test Suite** is a comprehensive testing implementation for a MERN-based quiz application that allows users to test their tech knowledge. This project emphasizes the importance of integrating robust testing practices using Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests. The application presents users with ten randomized tech questions and calculates the final score upon completion.

This suite enhances a fully functional application by introducing automated testing to ensure performance, accuracy, and user satisfaction across different usage scenarios.

## Features

- **Cypress Integration**: Component and end-to-end testing using Cypress.
- **Quiz Gameplay**: Ten randomized tech questions per quiz session.
- **Live Score Feedback**: Users see their final score immediately after completion.
- **Replayability**: Option to restart the quiz after each round.
- **React Frontend**: Modern user interface built with React.
- **Node/Express API**: Backend logic and API functionality.
- **MongoDB Database**: Stores quiz content and results.
